Basic Syntax in python 



Basic syntax of a Python program means rules to define the correct structure of statements and expressions used in that program. Therefore, under this section, we look up the basic structure of a Python program. Or how a Python program can be written to produce effective output.

Unlike most other programming languages like C, C++, Java etc. Python provides little simple syntax to work on. That is, to print Hello World in Python, we need to write only this single statement:

print("Hello World")

Note - Even semicolon does not require to put at last of the statement. This is the very simple structure of Python.


While learning about the basic syntax of Python or the basic structure of a Python program, the main thing to look up is the indentation of program. So let's talk about it.

Now the question is, what is indentation ?
The answer is, indentation refers to the spaces available/given at beginning of a statement in Python program. Before going deep into it, let's take a look at the program given check the file BasicSyntax.py
